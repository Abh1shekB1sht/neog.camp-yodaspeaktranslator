Hello and Welcome
My name is Abhishek
This project is created following the neog.camp-leson-four session.

This project is named Yoda Speak Translator.
This project takes input from the user and converts in to the yoda language.
User can write anything as the input.
The output so generated is the translated version of the latter into the Yoda language.
I had great fun creating the project.
