          Convert from English to Yoda speak. Yoda often orders sentences as
          Object-Subject-Verb, split verbs, switches entire phrases and
          sometimes uses sentences that are different from his normal syntax!
          Because of this it is difficult to accurately represent his sentence
          structure. But we tried hard and we constantly improve our patterns.
          Have fun and may the force be with you! Yoda is a registered trademark
          of Disney.
